            <p>I have a lifelong passion for understanding and solving problems.  Whether coding, simulations or puzzles, I am driven to dig in and understand what is going on and loves when the lightbulb goes off and I discover the solution or the missing piece.  I love collaborating with others to watch ideas become a reality.  When I am interested in a subject I need to learn everything I can about it.   I have a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering and 13 years experience in designing small and large oil and gas facilities around the world.  I am experienced in debugging simulation software and designing fit-for-purpose client solutions while collaborating with remote and diverse multi-disciplinary teams.   When not working, you can find me with my nose in a book, enjoying time with family and friends, testing out a new recipe or in the summer on the reservoir paddling. She is excited to use her skills to solve the next tech puzzle.</p>
